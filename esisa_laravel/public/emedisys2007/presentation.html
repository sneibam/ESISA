							  <p class="SimpleText"><span><strong>E-Medisys</strong> is a new international conference, very innovative, <br>
						      on the topic of the telemedicine.<br>
						      This conference was born out of collaboration  of three teams <br>
						      of research divided between Sfax (<strong>Tunisia</strong>), Besan&ccedil;on (<strong>France</strong>) <br>
						      and Fez (<strong>Morocco</strong>).</span></p>
							  <p class="SimpleText">E-Medisys, from its topic  interdisciplinary, has the role to bring<br>
							    together the researchers, and the industrialists,  who are actors <br>
							    of the telemedicine as well from  the  medical point of view as <br>
							    from  the  data-processing  point  of  view. </p>
							  <p class="SimpleText">It  is  what  makes  a  single  event  of  it:  the  meeting  of  the <br>
							    actors   who   will   allow   treating   the   telemedicine   &ldquo; from <br>
							    beginning  to  end &rdquo;.  This   conference   will  be  held in <strong>French</strong> <br>
							    and in <strong>English</strong>.</p>
							  <p class="SimpleText">The topics of this conference are voluntarily opened in order <br>
							    to  support  the  participation  of many  teams  (researchers, <br>
							    teachers,   engineers,  industrialists  and  students).  A  broad <br>
							    place  will  be  reserved  for  the   new   ideas,  with  not  yet <br>
							    succeeded work, original work positioning clearly compared<br>
						      to what exists.</p>
							  <p><span class="SimpleText">You can download the call for paper in <a href="http://lifc.univ-fcomte.fr/~emedisys07/docs/E-Medisys_CallForPaper.pdf" target="_blank">PDF</a> format and <a href="docs/E-Medisys_CallForPaper.jpg" target="_blank">JPG</a> format.</span><br>
